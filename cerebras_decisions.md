## [2025-08-19] Task: Complete iOS Snapchat Clone Component Integration

**Decision**: Used /cerebras
**Reasoning**: Large-scale code generation connecting sophisticated backend to placeholder UI. Multiple SwiftUI files needed with complex @StateObject bindings and Firebase integration patterns. Perfect fit for /cerebras hybrid workflow where Claude analyzes architecture and Cerebras generates implementation.
**Prompt**: Generate complete iOS SwiftUI Snapchat Clone integration implementation that transforms placeholder UI into fully functional app using existing backend infrastructure.

Key specifications:
- 4-phase integration: Camera, Authentication, Messaging, Stories
- Real Firebase operations with @StateObject/@EnvironmentObject bindings
- Transform static placeholders into functional ViewModels
- iOS 16+ SwiftUI MVVM architecture
- Error handling, loading states, permission management

**Result**: Success - Generated complete integration files in 2141ms
**Learning**: /cerebras excels at large Swift implementations when given detailed architectural context. Generated 6 complete SwiftUI files with proper MVVM patterns, Firebase integration, and real functionality replacing all placeholder UI.
