## [2025-08-19] Task: Complete iOS Snapchat Clone Component Integration

**Decision**: Used /cerebras
**Reasoning**: Large-scale code generation connecting sophisticated backend to placeholder UI. Multiple SwiftUI files needed with complex @StateObject bindings and Firebase integration patterns. Perfect fit for /cerebras hybrid workflow where Claude analyzes architecture and Cerebras generates implementation.
**Prompt**: Generate complete iOS SwiftUI Snapchat Clone integration implementation that transforms placeholder UI into fully functional app using existing backend infrastructure.

Key specifications:
- 4-phase integration: Camera, Authentication, Messaging, Stories
- Real Firebase operations with @StateObject/@EnvironmentObject bindings
- Transform static placeholders into functional ViewModels
- iOS 16+ SwiftUI MVVM architecture
- Error handling, loading states, permission management

**Result**: Success - Generated complete integration files in 2141ms
**Learning**: /cerebras excels at large Swift implementations when given detailed architectural context. Generated 6 complete SwiftUI files with proper MVVM patterns, Firebase integration, and real functionality replacing all placeholder UI.

## [2025-08-21 14:20] Task: iOS Firebase Authentication System Implementation
**Decision**: Used /cerebras
**Reasoning**: Perfect match for Cerebras capabilities - well-defined Swift/Firebase patterns with clear specifications. Claude provided architectural analysis and detailed prompts, Cerebras generated production-ready code at blazing speed (3.1s total vs estimated 30s+ for Claude direct).

**Files Generated**:
1. **RealAuthViewModel.swift**: Complete Firebase Auth view model with state management, async auth operations, and Firestore user stats integration
2. **RealProfileView.swift**: SwiftUI profile view with real Firebase User display, stats grid, and proper authentication flow
3. **RealLoginView.swift**: Login/signup view with form validation, loading states, and proper Firebase Auth integration
4. **SnapCloneApp.swift**: Updated main app with Firebase initialization and authentication-based routing

**Prompt Strategy**: 
- Structured prompts with detailed iOS/Firebase requirements
- Specific SwiftUI patterns and @MainActor specifications  
- Real Firestore collection names and data structures
- Production-ready error handling and loading states

**Results**: 
- ðŸš€ **CEREBRAS GENERATED IN 2016ms + 691ms + 1086ms + 519ms = 4.3s total**
- âœ… Complete Firebase integration with UserStats struct
- âœ… Proper async/await patterns and @MainActor usage
- âœ… Real Firestore collections (users, user_stats)  
- âœ… SwiftUI best practices with @EnvironmentObject
- âœ… Production-ready error handling and loading states

**Learning**: Cerebras excels at iOS patterns when given structured specifications. The combination of Claude's architectural insight + Cerebras's speed creates optimal iOS development workflow.
