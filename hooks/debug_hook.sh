# Debug Hook for Claude Code CLI
# Purpose: Executed before each tool use to provide debug context
# Status: Minimal implementation to eliminate hook errors

# For now, just exit successfully to prevent error messages
# TODO: Add actual debug functionality if needed (logging, state inspection, etc.)
