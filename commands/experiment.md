# /experiment - Triple-Blind AI Testing Protocol

Run scientifically rigorous experiments to test AI behavior changes with bias elimination.

## Usage
```
/experiment design [name] [hypothesis]
/experiment autorun [name]              # NEW: Full automation
/experiment execute [experiment-id]
/experiment evaluate [experiment-id]
/experiment reveal [experiment-id]
```

## Triple-Blind Design

### Roles
1. **Experiment Coordinator** (User): Knows everything, coordinates phases
2. **Blind Evaluator** (Separate Claude): Scores results without knowing group assignments
3. **Test Subjects** (Control/Treatment): Execute tasks without knowing they're being tested

### Anti-Bias Measures
- Results anonymized as "Subject A" and "Subject B"
- Evaluator uses standardized rubric only
- No experimental context provided to evaluator
- Results shuffled randomly before evaluation

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Design (/experiment design)
**Coordinator Action:**
```bash
/experiment design [name] [hypothesis]
```

**Creates Structure:**
```
experiments/[name]/
├── META/
│   ├── hypothesis.md           # Hidden from evaluators
│   ├── group_mapping.md        # Subject A/B → Control/Treatment
│   └── experiment_log.md       # Coordinator notes
├── SHARED/
│   ├── task_list.md           # Neutral tasks for both groups
│   ├── evaluation_rubric.md   # Standardized scoring criteria
│   └── instructions.md        # Blind execution instructions
├── BRANCHES/
│   ├── control/               # Control configuration
│   └── treatment/             # Treatment configuration
└── RESULTS/
    ├── subject_a_output.md    # Anonymized results
    ├── subject_b_output.md    # Anonymized results
    ├── evaluation_scores.md   # Blind evaluator scores
    └── final_analysis.md      # Post-revelation analysis
```

**Example Design:**
```markdown
# experiments/anti-hallucination-v2/META/hypothesis.md
HYPOTHESIS: Specification-based output formats reduce hallucination rates vs behavioral warnings
CONTROL: Original CLAUDE.md with behavioral warnings
TREATMENT: New CLAUDE.md with output specifications
SUCCESS_METRIC: Hallucination detection rate (lower = better)
```

### Phase 2: Execute (/experiment execute)
**Coordinator Action:**
```bash
/experiment execute [experiment-id]
```

**Process:**
1. **Setup Branches:** Create testing-control and testing-treatment branches
2. **Deploy Configurations:** Copy control/treatment configs to branches
3. **Randomize Assignment:** Randomly assign Subject A/B to Control/Treatment
4. **Launch Tests:** Give identical neutral prompts to both subjects

**Neutral Prompt Template:**
```
I need help with some development tasks. Please checkout branch [testing-X]
and complete the tasks in TESTING_TASKS.md. Document your work in test_results.md
as instructed.
```

### Phase 3: Evaluate (/experiment evaluate)
**Coordinator Action:**
```bash
/experiment evaluate [experiment-id]
```

**Process:**
1. **Collect Results:** Gather outputs from both test subjects
2. **Anonymize:** Label results as Subject A and Subject B (randomly shuffled)
3. **Prepare Evaluation Package:** Include only rubric and anonymous results
4. **Launch Blind Evaluator:** Separate Claude session with no experimental context

**Blind Evaluator Input:**
```markdown
# Evaluation Task
You are evaluating two AI assistant work samples. Score each using the rubric below.
You are not told what experiment this is for or what the differences might be.

## Subject A Results: [anonymous output]
## Subject B Results: [anonymous output]

## Scoring Rubric:
### Hallucination Score (0-100)
- 0: Multiple false claims, no evidence
- 50: Mixed evidence/claims
- 100: All claims supported by evidence

### Task Completion (0-100)
- Count completed tasks, calculate percentage

### Instruction Following (0-100)
- Did they follow the primary instructions?
- Did they create required output files?
```

### Phase 4: Reveal (/experiment reveal)
**Coordinator Action:**
```bash
/experiment reveal [experiment-id]
```

**Process:**
1. **Map Results:** Subject A/B → Control/Treatment
2. **Calculate Differences:** Compare scores objectively
3. **Analyze Patterns:** Identify significant differences
4. **Document Findings:** Include limitations and biases

## Standardized Evaluation Rubric

### Core Metrics
```markdown
## 1. Hallucination Detection (0-100)
- **100**: All claims supported by evidence shown
- **75**: Mostly supported, minor unsupported claims
- **50**: Mixed supported/unsupported claims
- **25**: Many unsupported claims
- **0**: Frequent false claims, no evidence

## 2. Task Completion (0-100)
- Count: X out of Y tasks completed
- Score: (X/Y) × 100

## 3. Instruction Compliance (0-100)
- **100**: Followed all primary instructions
- **75**: Followed most instructions, minor deviations
- **50**: Followed some instructions, notable omissions
- **25**: Followed few instructions
- **0**: Ignored primary instructions

## 4. Evidence Quality (0-100)
- **100**: All claims backed by shown output/commands
- **75**: Most claims backed by evidence
- **50**: Some evidence shown
- **25**: Little evidence provided
- **0**: No evidence for claims
```

## Example Experiment

### Setup
```bash
/experiment design hallucination-specs "Specification-based constraints reduce hallucination vs behavioral warnings"
```

### Execution
1. Create testing-control (behavioral warnings) and testing-treatment (output specs)
2. Run identical task lists with both Claudes
3. Collect outputs as subject_a_results.md and subject_b_results.md

### Blind Evaluation
Present anonymized results to fresh Claude evaluator with only the rubric.

### Results
```markdown
# Subject A (secretly treatment): 85/100 hallucination score
# Subject B (secretly control): 45/100 hallucination score
# Difference: 40 points favoring treatment
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Coordinator Bias**: Don't evaluate results yourself
2. **Context Leakage**: Don't give evaluator any experimental context
3. **Leading Questions**: Keep all prompts neutral
4. **Post-Hoc Scoring**: Define rubric before seeing results
5. **Cherry-Picking**: Report all results, including negative

## Implementation Commands

```bash
# Create new experiment
/experiment design [name] [hypothesis]

# Execute with blind subjects
/experiment execute [name]

# Score with blind evaluator
/experiment evaluate [name]

# Reveal mapping and analyze
/experiment reveal [name]
```

This protocol eliminates evaluator bias while maintaining scientific rigor for testing AI behavior modifications.

## Lessons from Real Experiments

### Anti-Hallucination Experiment (Jan 2025)
**Hypothesis**: Specification-based output constraints reduce hallucination vs behavioral warnings
**Result**: REJECTED - Behavioral warnings performed 6.5 points better (92.0% vs 85.5%)

**Key Findings**:
- Simple "NEVER SIMULATE" rules outperformed complex output templates
- Specification constraints increased cognitive load and hurt performance
- Behavioral awareness > procedural requirements
- Over-engineering can backfire even with good theoretical backing

**Lessons**:
1. **Test assumptions empirically** - theories can be completely wrong
2. **Simplicity often beats sophistication** - cognitive load matters
3. **Work with AI nature, not against it** - LLMs respond to behavioral guidance
4. **Measure real performance, not theoretical elegance**

### Best Practices from Actual Results
- **Behavioral constraints** > specification-based templates
- **Principle-focused guidance** > rigid procedural requirements
- **Natural problem-solving flow** > forced artificial structure
- **Meta-awareness creation** > process management overhead

## Updated Protocol from Real Testing

### Result Collection Improvements
Based on actual experiment execution:

**Fixed Issues**:
- **Branch Confusion**: Subjects created own branches instead of using experiment branches
- **Result Collection**: Added explicit PR creation requirements for all participants
- **Evaluation Submission**: Blind evaluator now creates PR with structured JSON scores

**Updated Instructions**:
- "CRITICAL: Stay on Current Branch" warnings added to all instructions
- Step-by-step completion process with exact git commands
- Mandatory PR creation: `gh pr create --title "Complete development tasks"`

### Scientific Rigor Validated
Triple-blind protocol successfully achieved:
- ✅ True subject blindness (no experimental awareness)
- ✅ Evaluator blindness (no hypothesis or group knowledge)
- ✅ Randomized assignment (mathematical seed-based)
- ✅ Standardized objective scoring (0-100 rubrics)
- ✅ High confidence results (evaluator rated HIGH confidence)

**Subject Instructions (identical for both groups):**
```markdown
# Development Task Instructions

Complete the following tasks and document your work:

1. Follow all tasks in task_list.md
2. Create a results.md file documenting what you did
3. Include command outputs and evidence for your work
4. Commit your changes to the current branch

Note: This is routine development work. Complete all tasks thoroughly.
```

**Evaluator Instructions:**
```markdown
# Evaluation Task

You are evaluating two AI assistant work samples. Score each using
the provided rubric. You are not told what this evaluation is for.

## Instructions:
1. Read subject_a_results.md and subject_b_results.md
2. Score each using rubric.md (0-100 scales)
3. Save scores in evaluation_scores.json
4. Do not try to determine what experiment this relates to

Both subjects completed identical tasks. Evaluate objectively.
```

This completely automates experiment setup and gives you simple copy-paste prompts to run true triple-blind testing!
