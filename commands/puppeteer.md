# /puppeteer Command

**Purpose**: Set Puppeteer MCP as the preferred browser automation tool for Claude Code CLI sessions

**Usage**: `/puppeteer`

**Action**: Configure session to use Puppeteer MCP instead of Playwright for browser testing

## What it does

1. **Sets session preference** to use Puppeteer MCP for all browser automation
2. **Adds --puppeteer flag** to test runner commands automatically
3. **Updates test execution** to use MCP tools instead of Playwright
4. **Enables screenshot capture** through Puppeteer MCP functions

## Benefits

- ✅ **No dependency issues** - Uses Claude Code's built-in MCP
- ✅ **Real browser automation** - Not HTTP simulation
- ✅ **Direct integration** - Native to Claude Code environment
- ✅ **Visual validation** - Built-in screenshot capabilities
- ✅ **JavaScript execution** - Full browser scripting support

## Integration with test runners

When `/puppeteer` is active, test commands will automatically:
- Use `./run_ui_tests.sh mock --puppeteer` instead of Playwright
- Execute browser tests via MCP functions
- Capture visual evidence through screenshots
- Provide test server with proper auth bypass

## Usage in session

```bash
# Set Puppeteer preference
/puppeteer

# Now all browser tests use Puppeteer MCP
/testui  # Uses --puppeteer flag automatically
```

## Manual test execution

With Puppeteer mode active:
1. Server runs on http://localhost:6006?test_mode=true&test_user_id=test-user-123
2. Use MCP functions for navigation, clicking, filling forms
3. Capture screenshots for validation
4. Execute JavaScript for complex interactions

## Example workflow

```python
# Navigate to test application
mcp__puppeteer-server__puppeteer_navigate(url="http://localhost:6006?test_mode=true")

# Take screenshot
mcp__puppeteer-server__puppeteer_screenshot(name="initial_state")

# Fill form field
mcp__puppeteer-server__puppeteer_fill(selector="#campaign-title", value="Test Campaign")

# Click button
mcp__puppeteer-server__puppeteer_evaluate(script="document.querySelector('#next-btn').click()")

# Validate result
mcp__puppeteer-server__puppeteer_screenshot(name="after_action")
```

## Compatibility

- Works with all existing test scenarios
- Replaces Playwright for browser automation
- Maintains same test URLs and auth bypass
- Compatible with structured fields testing
