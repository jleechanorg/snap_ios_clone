# Memory Integration for Slash Commands

## Overview
Enhanced command wrappers provide memory pattern integration for improved execution quality and consistency.

## Enhanced Commands Available

### /execute-enhanced
**Aliases**: /ee, /e+
**Description**: Memory-enhanced execution with pattern guidance
**Memory Enabled**: Yes

### /plan-enhanced
**Aliases**: /plan+, /pe
**Description**: Memory-informed planning with pattern consultation
**Memory Enabled**: Yes

### /testui-enhanced
**Aliases**: /testui+, /tue
**Description**: Pattern-aware UI testing with learned preferences
**Memory Enabled**: Yes

### /learn-enhanced
**Aliases**: /learn+, /le
**Description**: Enhanced learning with pattern analysis
**Memory Enabled**: Yes


## Memory Integration Features

### Pattern Consultation
- Automatic query of learned patterns before execution
- Relevance scoring and pattern categorization
- Context-aware decision making

### Pattern Application
- Critical corrections applied automatically
- User preferences incorporated
- Workflow patterns followed
- Technical insights applied

### Learning Integration
- Execution outcomes feed back to memory
- User corrections captured as patterns
- Continuous improvement of command behavior

## Usage Examples

### Standard vs Enhanced
```bash
# Standard execution
/execute implement user auth

# Enhanced execution with memory
/ee implement user auth
/execute-enhanced implement user auth
```
