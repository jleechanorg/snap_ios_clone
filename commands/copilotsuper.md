# GitHub Copilot Super Command

**Purpose**: Run comprehensive Copilot analysis on multiple PRs using orchestration agents

**Usage**: `/copilotsuper PR1 [PR2 PR3...]` or `/copilots PR1 [PR2 PR3...]`

**Action**: Uses orchestration system (see `orchestrate.md`) to spawn individual agents for processing multiple PRs in parallel with full Copilot analysis and fixes

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Each PR gets its own orchestration agent working simultaneously
- **Complete Isolation**: Each agent uses isolated worktree to protect current work
- **Scalability**: Handle 10+ PRs concurrently (limited only by system resources)
- **Option 3 Architecture**: Uses integrated `copilot.py` with parallel data collection
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full GitHub comment extraction, test fixing, and CI resolution
- **Automatic Fixes**: Each agent commits and pushes changes to make PRs mergeable
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Skip unnecessary stages when PRs are already clean
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track all agents' progress and aggregate results

## 🔧 Implementation Approach

**🚨 ORCHESTRATION INTEGRATION**: Uses the orchestration system's agent reuse architecture (see `orchestrate.md` for complete details).

**Core Workflow**:
1. **Parse PR Numbers**: Validate and collect PR arguments
2. **Delegate to Orchestration**: Uses `/orchestrate` to spawn individual agents per PR
3. **Agent Reuse Optimization**: Leverages orchestration's 50-80% efficiency gains through intelligent agent reuse
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track all agents via orchestration system
5. **Aggregate Results**: Compile summary from all agent results

**Individual Agent Per PR with Custom Workspace Management**:
```bash
# Delegates to orchestration system with custom workspace configuration for tmux-pr naming
for PR in $PR_LIST; do
    # Calculate workspace paths consistent with tmux-pr naming convention
    main_repo_path="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"
    worktrees_root="${WORKTREE_ROOT:-"$(dirname "$main_repo_path")/.worktrees"}"
    workspace_name="tmux-pr${PR}"
    
    # Delegate to orchestration with custom workspace configuration
    /orchestrate "Run copilot analysis on PR #$PR --workspace-name $workspace_name --workspace-root $worktrees_root"
done
```

## 🏗️ Git Worktree Management

**Integrated with Orchestration System**: Each tmux agent spawns in independent git worktrees using the orchestration system's configurable workspace management, ensuring complete isolation and preventing conflicts.

**Enhanced Orchestration Integration**:
```bash
# Copilotsuper delegates to orchestration with embedded workspace configuration
for PR in $PR_LIST; do
    # Calculate workspace paths following tmux-pr{ID} naming convention
    main_repo_path="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"
    worktrees_root="${WORKTREE_ROOT:-"$(dirname "$main_repo_path")/.worktrees"}"
    workspace_name="tmux-pr${PR}"
    
    # Delegate to orchestration with workspace config embedded in task description
    /orchestrate "Run copilot analysis on PR #$PR --workspace-name $workspace_name --workspace-root $worktrees_root"
done
```

**Orchestration System Integration**:
The orchestration system's `create_dynamic_agent()` function now accepts custom workspace configuration and automatically aligns agent names with workspace directories:

```python
# Enhanced orchestration agent creation with unified naming
agent_spec = {
    "name": agent_name,                               # Will be updated to match workspace_name
    "focus": f"Run copilot analysis on PR #{pr_number}",
    "workspace_config": {
        "workspace_name": f"tmux-pr{pr_number}",      # Agent name becomes: tmux-pr1234
        "workspace_root": worktrees_root              # External .worktrees directory
    }
}

# Result: Agent session name = tmux-pr1234, Workspace directory = tmux-pr1234
```

**Unified Naming & Workspace Management**:
- ✅ **Perfect Alignment**: Agent session names now match workspace directory names exactly
- ✅ **Meaningful Names**: Default orchestration uses task-based names instead of timestamps
- ✅ **Consistent PR Format**: `tmux-pr{ID}` format for all PR-related work across both systems
- ✅ **External Location**: Worktrees created in `.worktrees` directory outside main repo  
- ✅ **Reuse Optimization**: Orchestration checks for existing workspaces by name first
- ✅ **Branch Isolation**: Each task gets completely isolated git environment
- ✅ **Unified Cleanup**: Single orchestration system handles all workspace lifecycle management
- ✅ **Parameter Extraction**: Workspace configuration embedded in task descriptions and automatically extracted

**New Naming Examples**:
- **Default Tasks**: `task-agent-implement-auth` (instead of `task-agent-44509833`)
- **PR Tasks**: `tmux-pr1234` (agent name = workspace name = `tmux-pr1234`)
- **Workspaces**: Match agent names exactly (no more `agent_workspace_` prefix)

**Worktree Benefits**:
- ✅ **Perfect Isolation**: Each PR analysis in separate git environment
- ✅ **Reuse Optimization**: Existing worktrees reused for repeated analysis  
- ✅ **Consistent Naming**: `tmux-pr1234` format for easy identification
- ✅ **Safe External Location**: Created in `.worktrees` directory outside main repo
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid worktrees detected and cleaned
- ✅ **Security**: PR number validation prevents path injection attacks

**Key Benefits** (via orchestration system):
- ✅ **Agent Reuse**: 50-80% efficiency gains through intelligent reuse
- ✅ **Complete Isolation**: Each PR gets dedicated agent workspace
- ✅ **100% Coverage**: Every PR processed by individual agent
- ✅ **Resource Optimization**: Strategic reuse without compromising quality
