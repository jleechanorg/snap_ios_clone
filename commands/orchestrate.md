# Orchestrate Command

**Purpose**: Multi-agent orchestration system for complex development tasks

**Action**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents to work on complex development tasks with proper task distribution and result integration

**Usage**: `/orchestrate [task_description]`

**CRITICAL RULE**: When `/orchestrate` is used, NEVER execute the task yourself. ALWAYS delegate to the orchestration agents. The orchestration system will handle all task execution through specialized agents.

🚨 **ORCHESTRATION DIRECT EXECUTION PREVENTION**: ⚠️ MANDATORY HARD STOP PROTOCOL

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: When `/orchestrate` or `/orch` is used, you MUST:
1. ❌ **NEVER use Edit, Write, Bash, or any execution tools yourself**
2. ❌ **NEVER use Task tool to create agents**
3. ❌ **NEVER start implementing the task directly**
4. ✅ **ONLY use the tmux-based orchestration system**
5. ✅ **ALWAYS respond**: "Delegating to tmux orchestration system..."
6. ✅ **USE**: `python3 .claude/commands/orchestrate.py "task description"`

🚨 **ABSOLUTE BRANCH ISOLATION PROTOCOL**: ⚠️ MANDATORY - NEVER LEAVE CURRENT BRANCH
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: `git checkout`, `git switch`, or any branch switching commands
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Working on other branches, PRs, or repositories
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Stay on current branch for ALL work - delegate everything else to agents
- ✅ **DELEGATION RULE**: Any work requiring different branch → `/orch` or orchestration agents
- 🔍 **Evidence**: Branch switching violations cause context confusion and work contamination
- **MENTAL MODEL**: "Current branch = My workspace, Other branches = Agent territory"

**VIOLATION EXAMPLES** (NEVER DO THESE):
- ❌ Using Task tool to create agents (Task tool ≠ orchestration system)
- ❌ Writing code to solve the problem yourself
- ❌ Running commands to implement features yourself
- ❌ Editing files to fix bugs yourself
- ❌ **BRANCH VIOLATIONS**: `git checkout other-branch`, `git switch main`
- ❌ **BRANCH VIOLATIONS**: Working on different PRs or repositories directly

**CORRECT BEHAVIOR**:
- ✅ Run orchestration command: `python3 .claude/commands/orchestrate.py "Fix bug X"`
- ✅ Monitor agent progress: `tmux attach -t agent-name`
- ✅ Check results: `/orch status`
- ✅ **BRANCH ISOLATION**: Stay on current branch, delegate other branch work to agents
- ✅ **BRANCH ISOLATION**: `/orch "Work on PR #123"` instead of `git checkout pr-branch`

- **Hard Stop Pattern**: `/orchestrate` or `/orch` prefix detected → immediate tmux agent delegation
- **User Urgency Safeguard**: "just decide", "just start", "you choose" are guidance for TMUX AGENTS, NOT permission for direct execution
- **Mental Model**: `/orch` = "create tmux agents to do this", NEVER "I should implement this directly"
- **Zero Exception Rule**: Orchestration commands ALWAYS trigger tmux agent creation regardless of user urgency
- **Behavioral Firewall**: Automatic "Delegating to tmux orchestration system..." response followed by tmux agent creation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Operational command classification → mandatory tmux protocol enforcement
- 🔍 **Evidence**: Session violation prevented by this protocol (see CLAUDE.md)
- **CRITICAL**: Task tool ≠ orchestration system. Orchestration = tmux agents only.

**🚨 CRITICAL BRANCH PROTECTION RULE**: When monitoring orchestration agents:
- ❌ **NEVER switch branches** without explicit user permission
- ❌ **NEVER leave the current branch** to investigate agent work
- ✅ **ALWAYS stay on your current branch** while agents work in their isolated workspaces
- ✅ **Request explicit approval** before any branch switch: "May I switch to branch X? Please approve with 'approve [number]'"
- 🔒 **Branch Context**: Your branch = your workspace. Agent branches = their workspaces. Never mix them!
- ⚠️ **Violation Impact**: Switching branches disrupts user's work context and can cause lost changes

**Implementation**:
- **Python Script**: `python3 .claude/commands/orchestrate.py [task_description]`
- **Shell Wrapper**: `./claude_command_scripts/orchestrate.sh` (if available)
- **Tmux Agents**: Creates real tmux sessions with Claude Code CLI agents
- **NOT Task Tool**: Task tool is for different purposes, orchestration uses tmux system
- **System Check**: ALWAYS checks system status first before executing tasks

**Features**:
- **Real tmux sessions**: Creates separate terminal sessions for each agent
- **Claude Code CLI integration**: Full access to all slash commands in each session
- **Task delegation**: Smart routing based on task content (UI→frontend, API→backend, etc.)
- **Progress monitoring**: Real-time status via `/orchestrate What's the status?`
- **Agent collaboration**: Direct connection to agent sessions for collaboration
- **Natural language**: Understands commands like "Build user authentication urgently"
- **Priority handling**: Recognizes urgent, ASAP, critical keywords
- **Agent reuse optimization**: Idle agents reused before creating new ones (50-80% efficiency gains)
- **Individual agent per task**: Each task gets dedicated agent with complete isolation
- **Resource efficiency**: Strategic reuse while maintaining task isolation

**System Requirements**:
- Redis server running (for coordination)
- Orchestration system started: `./orchestration/start_system.sh start`
- Or started via: `./claude_start.sh` (auto-starts orchestration when not running git hooks)

**Automatic Behavior**:
- `/orch` commands automatically check if the orchestration system is running
- If not running, attempts to start it before executing the task
- Shows clear status messages about system state
- **Memory Integration**: Automatically queries Memory MCP for:
  - Past mistakes and learnings related to the task
  - Previous similar orchestration patterns
  - Known issues and their solutions
  - This helps agents avoid repeating past errors
  - **Note**: If Memory MCP is unavailable, tasks proceed without memory context (non-blocking)

**Agent Types**:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI, React components, styling (`frontend-agent`)
- **Backend Agent**: APIs, database, server logic (`backend-agent`)
- **Testing Agent**: Tests, QA, validation (`testing-agent`)
- **Opus Master**: Coordination and oversight (`opus-master`)
- **Task Agents**: Dynamic agents with reuse optimization (`task-agent-*`)

**Examples**:
- `/orchestrate implement user authentication with tests and documentation`
- `/orchestrate refactor database layer with migration scripts`
- `/orchestrate add new feature with full test coverage and UI updates`
- `/orchestrate optimize performance across frontend and backend`
- `/orchestrate Run copilot analysis on PR #123 with agent reuse preference`
- `/orchestrate What's the status?`
- `/orchestrate connect to sonnet 1`
- `/orchestrate monitor agents`
- `/orchestrate help me with connections`

**Natural Language Commands**:
- **Task Delegation**: "Build X", "Create Y", "Implement Z urgently"
- **System Monitoring**: "What's the status?", "monitor agents", "How's the progress?"
- **Agent Connection**: "connect to sonnet 1", "collaborate with sonnet-2"
- **Help**: "help me with connections", "show me connection options"

**Quick Commands**:
- **Start system**: `./orchestration/start_system.sh start`
- **Check status**: `/orchestrate What's the status?`
- **Connect to frontend**: `tmux attach -t frontend-agent`
- **Connect to backend**: `tmux attach -t backend-agent`
- **Connect to testing**: `tmux attach -t testing-agent`
- **Monitor all**: `tmux list-sessions | grep -E '(frontend|backend|testing|opus)'`


## Important Notes

- **Working Directory**: The orchestration system creates agent workspaces as subdirectories. Always ensure you're in the main project directory when running orchestration commands, not inside an agent workspace
- **Monitoring**: Use `tmux attach -t [agent-name]` to watch agent progress
- **Results**: Check `/tmp/orchestration_results/` for agent completion status
- **Cleanup**: Run `orchestration/cleanup_agents.sh` to remove completed agent worktrees
- **Branch Context**: Agents inherit from your current branch, so their changes build on your work

## 🚨 AGENT TASK PATIENCE

Agent tasks require TIME - wait for completion before ANY declaration:
- ⚠️ Orchestrate agents work autonomously and may take 5-10+ minutes
- ❌ NEVER declare success OR failure without checking completion status
- ❌ NEVER make declarations based on quick checks (10s, 30s, 60s too soon)
- ✅ ALWAYS check tmux output for "Task completed" message
- ✅ ALWAYS verify PR creation in agent output before declaring results
- 🔍 Evidence: Agent task-agent-5819 succeeded with PR #851 after 270 seconds
- 📋 Proper verification: tmux output → "Task completed" → PR URL → verify PR exists
- ⚠️ Status warnings like "agent may still be working" mean WAIT, don't declare

## 🔄 PR UPDATE MODE vs CREATE MODE

**CRITICAL**: Agents must detect whether to UPDATE existing PRs or CREATE new ones:

### 🔍 PR Update Pattern Detection
The orchestration system recognizes these patterns as PR UPDATE requests:
- **Explicit PR references**: "fix PR #123", "update pull request #456", "adjust PR #789"
- **Contextual PR references**: "adjust the PR", "fix the pull request", "update that PR"
- **Action words with PR**: "modify", "fix", "adjust", "update", "enhance", "improve" + "PR/pull request"
- **Continuation phrases**: "continue with PR", "add to the PR", "the PR needs", "PR should also"

### 🆕 PR Create Patterns (Default)
These patterns trigger NEW PR creation:
- **No PR mentioned**: "implement feature X", "fix bug Y", "create Z"
- **Explicit new work**: "create new PR for", "start fresh PR", "new pull request"
- **Independent tasks**: Tasks that don't reference existing work

### 📢 User Feedback
Orchestration will clearly indicate the detected mode:
```
🔍 Detected PR context: #950 - Agent will UPDATE existing PR
   Branch: feature-xyz
   Status: OPEN
```
OR
```
🆕 No PR context detected - Agent will create NEW PR
   New branch will be created from main
```

### ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **Merged/Closed PRs**: Agent will warn and ask for confirmation
- **Multiple PR mentions**: Agent will ask which PR to update
- **Ambiguous "the PR"**: System will show recent PRs and ask for selection
- **Branch conflicts**: Agent will attempt rebase/merge with clear messaging

## 🔄 Agent Reuse Optimization

**🚨 CRITICAL: Agent Reuse Architecture for Efficiency**

The orchestration system implements intelligent agent reuse to optimize resource utilization while maintaining task isolation.

### **Agent Reuse Strategy**:
1. **Check for Idle Agents**: Before creating new agents, check for idle existing agents
2. **Reuse When Available**: Reuse idle agents for new tasks (50-80% efficiency gains)
3. **Create When Needed**: Create new agents only when no idle agents available
4. **Maintain Isolation**: Each task still gets dedicated agent execution
5. **Resource Optimization**: Strategic reuse without compromising task quality

### **Individual Agent Per Task Architecture**:
- ✅ **Parallel Execution**: All tasks processed simultaneously (one agent per task)
- ✅ **Resource Efficiency**: Idle agents reused before creating new ones (50-80% token savings)
- ✅ **Complete Isolation**: Each agent has dedicated workspace and task focus
- ✅ **No Task Conflicts**: Worktrees and separate sessions prevent collisions
- ✅ **100% Coverage**: Every task gets individual agent (no partial processing)
- ✅ **Scalable**: Handle 10+ tasks with optimal resource utilization
- ✅ **Fault Tolerant**: One agent failure doesn't affect others
- ✅ **Real-time Visibility**: Monitor all individual agents' progress

### **Agent Lifecycle Management**:
```bash
# CORRECT: Agent reuse optimization workflow
for TASK in $TASK_LIST; do
    /orchestrate "$TASK with agent reuse preference"
done

# Each task execution with reuse:
# 1. Check for idle agents first
# 2. Reuse existing idle agent if available
# 3. Create new agent only if no idle agents
# 4. Execute task in complete isolation
# 5. Mark agent as idle after completion (available for reuse)
```

### **Performance Benefits**:
- **Token Savings**: 50-80% reduction in agent creation overhead
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of active agents
- **Faster Execution**: Reduced agent startup time through reuse
- **Cost Optimization**: Lower API costs through strategic reuse
- **Scalability**: Handle more concurrent tasks with same resources

### **Safety Guarantees**:
- ❌ **No Task Contamination**: Each task gets clean agent state
- ❌ **No Shared Context**: Agents don't share previous task context
- ✅ **Fresh Workspace**: Each task gets isolated worktree regardless of reuse
- ✅ **Complete Independence**: Task execution is fully independent
- ✅ **Error Isolation**: Agent reuse doesn't propagate errors between tasks
