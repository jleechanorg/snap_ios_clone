# Enhanced Command Aliases

Quick reference for enhanced command aliases with memory integration.

## Command Mappings

| Standard | Enhanced | Aliases | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/execute` | `/execute-enhanced` | `/ee`, `/e+` | Memory-enhanced execution with pattern guidance |
| `/plan` | `/plan-enhanced` | `/plan+`, `/pe` | Memory-informed planning with pattern consultation |
| `/testui` | `/testui-enhanced` | `/testui+`, `/tue` | Pattern-aware UI testing with learned preferences |
| `/learn` | `/learn-enhanced` | `/learn+`, `/le` | Enhanced learning with pattern analysis |

## Quick Start

### Most Common Enhanced Commands
```bash
/ee [task]          # Enhanced execute with memory
/plan+ [task]       # Enhanced planning with patterns
/testui+ [test]     # Pattern-aware UI testing
/learn+ [learning]  # Enhanced learning capture
```

### Memory Features
All enhanced commands provide:
- ðŸ§  **Pattern Consultation**: Automatic memory query
- ðŸš¨ **Critical Corrections**: High-confidence fixes applied
- ðŸŽ¯ **User Preferences**: Personal workflow preferences
- ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations**: Learned best practices

### Example Usage
```bash
# Enhanced execution with memory guidance
/ee implement user authentication system

# Enhanced testing with learned preferences
/testui+ test login form validation

# Enhanced learning with pattern analysis
/learn+ always use headless=True for CI tests
```

## Memory Consultation Process

1. **Pattern Query**: Search learned patterns for relevance
2. **Categorization**: Group by type (corrections, preferences, workflows)
3. **Application**: Apply relevant patterns to execution strategy
4. **Enhancement**: Improve command execution with memory insights

## Integration Benefits

âœ… **Consistency**: User preferences applied across commands
âœ… **Learning**: Commands improve with each interaction
âœ… **Efficiency**: Avoid repeating past mistakes
âœ… **Personalization**: AI behavior adapts to user style
âœ… **Quality**: Better execution decisions through memory
