# Claude Commands - Command Composition System

⚠️ **PROTOTYPE WIP REPOSITORY** - This is an experimental command system exported from a working development environment. Use as reference but note it hasn't been extensively tested outside of the original workflow. Expect adaptation needed for your specific setup.

Transform Claude Code into an autonomous development powerhouse through simple command hooks that enable complex workflow orchestration.

## 🚀 CLAUDE CODE SELF-SETUP

```bash
# Point Claude Code to this repository and let it set up what you need
"I want to use the commands from https://github.com/jleechanorg/claude-commands - please analyze what's available and set up the ones that would be useful for my project"
```

Claude Code will intelligently analyze your project, recommend relevant commands, and configure everything automatically.

## 🎯 The Magic: Simple Hooks → Powerful Workflows

This isn't just a collection of commands - it's a **complete workflow composition architecture** that transforms how you develop software.

### Command Chaining Examples
```bash
# Multi-command composition in single request (like /fake command)
"/arch /thinku /devilsadvocate /diligent"  # → comprehensive code analysis

# Sequential workflow chains
"/think about auth then /execute the solution"  # → analysis → implementation

# Conditional execution flows
"/test login flow and if fails /fix then /pr"  # → test → fix → create PR
```

### Before: Manual Step-by-Step Development
```
1. Analyze the issue manually
2. Write code manually
3. Test manually
4. Create PR manually
5. Handle review comments manually
```

### After: Single Command Workflows
```bash
/pr "fix authentication bug"     # → think → execute → push → copilot → review
/copilot                        # → analyze PR → fix all issues autonomously
/execute "add user dashboard"   # → plan → auto-approve → implement
/orch "implement notifications" # → multi-agent parallel development
```

## 🔍 Command Deep Dive - The Composition Powerhouses

### `/execute` - Plan-Approve-Execute Composition

**What It Does**: Combines `/plan` → `/preapprove` → `/autoapprove` → execute in one seamless workflow with TodoWrite tracking.

**3-Phase Workflow**:
1. **Planning Phase**: Executes `/plan` command - creates TodoWrite checklist and displays execution plan
2. **Approval Chain**: `/preapprove` validation followed by `/autoapprove` with message "User already approves - proceeding with execution"
3. **Implementation**: Systematic execution following the approved plan with progress updates

**Real Example**:
```bash
/execute "fix login button styling"
↓
Phase 1 - Planning (/plan): Creates TodoWrite checklist and execution plan
Phase 2 - Approval Chain: /preapprove → /autoapprove → "User already approves - proceeding"
Phase 3 - Implementation: [Check styles → Update CSS → Test → Commit]
```

### `/plan` - Manual Approval Development Planning

**What It Does**: Structured development planning with explicit user approval gates.

**Perfect For**: Complex architectural changes, high-risk modifications, learning new patterns.

**Workflow**:
1. **Deep Analysis**: Research existing system, constraints, requirements
2. **Multi-Approach Planning**: Present 2-3 different implementation approaches
3. **Resource Assessment**: Timeline, complexity, tool requirements, risk analysis
4. **Approval Gate**: User must explicitly approve before implementation
5. **Guided Execution**: Step-by-step implementation with checkpoints

### `/pr` - Complete Development Lifecycle

**What It Does**: Executes the complete 5-phase development lifecycle: `/think` → `/execute` → `/push` → `/copilot` → `/review`

**Mandatory 5-Phase Workflow**:
```
Phase 1: Think - Strategic analysis and approach planning
↓
Phase 2: Execute - Implementation using /execute workflow
↓
Phase 3: Push - Commit, push, and create PR with details
↓
Phase 4: Copilot - Auto-executed PR analysis and issue fixing
↓
Phase 5: Review - Comprehensive code review and validation
```

**Real Example**:
```bash
/pr "fix login timeout issue"
↓
Think: Analyze login flow and timeout causes →
Execute: Implement timeout fix systematically →
Push: Create PR with comprehensive details →
Copilot: Fix any automated feedback →
Review: Complete code review and validation
```

### `/copilot` - Universal PR Composition with Execute

**What It Does**: Targets current branch PR by default, delegates to `/execute` for intelligent 6-phase autonomous workflow.

**6-Phase Autonomous System**:
1. **PR Analysis**: Status check, CI analysis, comment gathering
2. **Issue Detection**: Systematic problem identification and prioritization
3. **Automated Resolution**: Intelligent fixing with `/execute` optimization
4. **Quality Assurance**: Test coverage, lint validation, self-review
5. **Communication**: Reply to comments, update PR descriptions
6. **Validation**: Final verification and completion confirmation

**Perfect For**: Full autonomous PR management without manual intervention.

**Real Example**:
```bash
/copilot  # Auto-targets current branch PR
↓
🎯 Targeting current branch PR: #123 →
🚀 Delegating to /execute for intelligent workflow →
Analyze → Fix → Test → Document → Reply → Verify
```

### `/orch` - Multi-Agent Task Delegation System

**What It Does**: Delegates tasks to autonomous tmux-based agents working in parallel across different branches.

**Multi-Agent Architecture**:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX implementation, browser testing, styling
- **Backend Agent**: API development, database integration, server logic
- **Testing Agent**: Test automation, validation, performance testing
- **Opus-Master**: Architecture decisions, code review, integration

**Real Example**:
```bash
/orch "add user notifications system"
↓
Frontend Agent: notification UI components (parallel)
Backend Agent: notification API endpoints (parallel)
Testing Agent: notification test suite (parallel)
Opus-Master: architecture review and integration
↓
All agents work independently → Create individual PRs → Integration verification
```

**Cost**: $0.003-$0.050 per task (highly efficient)

**Monitoring**:
```bash
/orch monitor agents    # Check agent status
/orch "What's running?" # Current task overview
tmux attach-session -t task-agent-frontend  # Direct agent access
```

## 💡 The Composition Architecture - How It Actually Works

### The Hook Mechanism

Each command is a **simple .md file** that Claude Code reads as executable instructions. When you type `/pr "fix bug"`, Claude:

1. **Reads** `.claude/commands/pr.md`
2. **Parses** the structured prompt template
3. **Executes** the workflow defined in the markdown
4. **Composes** with other commands through shared protocols

### Multi-Command Chaining in Single Sentences

You can chain multiple commands in one request:

```bash
# Sequential execution
"/think about authentication then /arch the solution then /execute it"

# Conditional execution
"/test the login flow and if it fails /fix it then /pr the changes"

# Parallel analysis
"/debug the performance issue while /research best practices then /plan implementation"

# Full workflow composition
"/analyze the codebase /design a solution /execute with tests /pr with documentation then /copilot any issues"
```
