# Intelligent Regression Testing with Playwright MCP

**Purpose**: Perform comprehensive regression testing using `/think` and `/execute`, comparing old Flask site to new React V2 site with full functionality validation

**Action**: Always use `/think` to analyze context, then `/execute` for systematic testing. Adapts plan based on user input after command.

**Usage**:
- `/testuif` (automatic analysis and testing)
- `/testuif [specific instructions]` (adapts plan to user requirements)

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Automatic Thinking & Planning

**🧠 ALWAYS START WITH `/think`:**
Execute `/think` to analyze:
- Current PR context and changed files
- Git diff analysis against main branch
- Frontend vs backend changes identification
- Risk assessment for functionality impacts
- Test strategy prioritization

### Phase 2: Plan Adaptation

**🎯 IF USER PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS:**
Adapt the plan based on user input after `/testuif`:
- Parse user requirements and constraints
- Modify testing scope and priorities accordingly
- Integrate user-specific test scenarios
- Adjust comparison strategy as requested

**📋 DEFAULT COMPARISON STRATEGY:**
When no specific instructions given:
- Test ALL functionality from Flask frontend in React V2
- Ensure feature parity between old and new sites
- Validate critical user journeys work identically
- Document any missing or broken functionality

### Phase 3: Systematic Execution

**⚡ ALWAYS USE `/execute`:**
Use `/execute` with comprehensive testing plan:

```
/execute
1. MANDATORY: Generate complete field interaction matrix (Campaign Type × Character × Setting × AI Options)
2. Apply smart matrix testing strategy (pairwise combinations + high-risk prioritization)
3. Set up browser automation environment (Playwright MCP with headless=true)
4. Execute Phase 1: High-risk matrix combinations (25 critical tests)
5. Execute Phase 2: Feature coverage matrix (35 comprehensive tests)
6. Execute Phase 3: Edge case matrix (20 boundary tests)
7. Test Flask frontend functionality (baseline) - ALL matrix paths
8. Test React V2 equivalent functionality - ALL matrix paths with dynamic placeholder verification
9. Compare feature parity with matrix cell-by-cell evidence
10. Document matrix findings with clickable screenshot links
11. Perform adversarial testing on previously failing matrix cells
12. Generate matrix coverage report with bug pattern analysis
13. Post comprehensive matrix results to PR documentation
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY QUALITY ASSURANCE INTEGRATION

**Quality Assurance Protocol**: See [CLAUDE.md §Mandatory QA Protocol](/CLAUDE.md#-mandatory-quality-assurance-protocol). All browser testing MUST comply.

### 📋 Pre-Testing Requirements (⚠️ MANDATORY)
- **Matrix Testing**: Apply full matrix methodology per canonical protocol
- **Evidence Collection**: Screenshot every test matrix cell with path labels
- **Completion Validation**: All validation gates from QA protocol required
- **Code Scanning**: Search for hardcoded values and patterns systematically
- **Adversarial Testing**: Attempt to break claimed fixes and verify related patterns
```

**🚨 MANDATORY HEADLESS CONFIGURATION:**
```bash
# Environment variables for headless enforcement
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=1
export BROWSER_HEADLESS=true

# Playwright MCP configuration with explicit headless flag
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_navigate --headless=true --url="http://localhost:8081"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --headless=true --filename="baseline.png"
```

## 🔍 Enhanced Screenshot Validation Protocol (2025)

**INTEGRATION**: Based on latest AI testing research, use advanced validation methods:

### **Method 1: Claude Vision Direct Analysis (Primary)**
```bash
# Capture screenshots to filesystem for Claude vision analysis
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
VALIDATION_DIR="/tmp/testuif_validation/$TIMESTAMP"
mkdir -p "$VALIDATION_DIR"

# Flask baseline screenshots
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="flask_dashboard" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/flask_dashboard.png"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="flask_campaign_creation" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/flask_campaign_creation.png"

# React V2 comparison screenshots
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="react_dashboard" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/react_dashboard.png"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="react_campaign_creation" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/react_campaign_creation.png"

# Claude analyzes screenshots directly using Read tool
echo "Screenshots saved to $VALIDATION_DIR for Claude vision analysis"
```

### **Method 2: Accessibility Tree + Visual Hybrid**
```bash
# Get structured accessibility data alongside screenshots
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_snapshot > "$VALIDATION_DIR/flask_accessibility.json"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_snapshot > "$VALIDATION_DIR/react_accessibility.json"

# Cross-validate structured data with visual confirmation
# Claude can read both JSON accessibility data AND screenshot images
```

### **Method 3: Progressive Baseline Comparison**
```bash
# Create baselines if they don't exist
if [ ! -d "/tmp/testuif_baselines" ]; then
    mkdir -p /tmp/testuif_baselines
    echo "Creating baseline screenshots for future comparisons"
    mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --path="/tmp/testuif_baselines/flask_baseline.png"
fi

# Compare current state against established baselines
# Use Claude vision to analyze differences between baseline and current screenshots
```

**🚨 FAILURE-EXIT SEMANTICS:**
```bash
# Exit codes for parity check failures
PARITY_CHECK_PASSED=0    # All functionality matches
PARITY_CHECK_FAILED=1    # Feature parity failures detected
CRITICAL_ERROR=2         # Browser automation or system errors

# Bail-on-failure implementation
set -e  # Exit immediately on any command failure
set -o pipefail  # Fail on any pipe command failure

# Example parity validation with non-zero exit
validate_feature_parity() {
    local flask_result="$1"
    local react_result="$2"

    if [ "$flask_result" != "$react_result" ]; then
        echo "❌ PARITY FAILURE: Feature mismatch detected"
        echo "Flask: $flask_result"
        echo "React: $react_result"
        exit $PARITY_CHECK_FAILED
    fi

    echo "✅ PARITY VERIFIED: Feature behavior matches"
    return 0
}
```

**🔄 FULL FUNCTIONALITY COMPARISON TESTING:**

**Flask Frontend (Baseline) - Test ALL of:**
- Landing page and authentication flows
- Campaign list, creation, and management
- Campaign gameplay and story continuation
- Settings, profile, and user preferences
- Navigation, routing, and deep linking
- Asset loading, performance, and errors

**React V2 Frontend (New) - Validate SAME functionality:**
- Identical user journeys and workflows
- Feature-complete comparison to Flask
- Performance and user experience validation
- Integration with Flask backend APIs
- Authentication and session management
- Error handling and edge cases

### Hardcoded Values Detection
"Read [screenshot] and check for:
1. Any hardcoded 'Ser Arion' character names
2. 'Loading campaign details...' placeholder text
3. Static 'intermediate • fantasy' labels
4. Non-functional button placeholders
Format as: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL with exact locations"

### Feature Parity Visual Verification

1. Identical UI layout and positioning
2. Same data displayed in both versions
3. Consistent button placement and functionality
4. Visual elements match expected design
Report differences with pixel-level precision"

### Visual Regression Analysis
"Analyze [current_screenshot] vs [baseline_screenshot]:
1. Layout shifts or element displacement

3. Missing or added UI elements
4. Text content modifications
Provide regression score (0-100%) with change summary"
```
