# /design - Product & Engineering Design Documentation

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive product specification and engineering design documents to prevent implementation failures through proper planning

**Usage**: `/design [feature-name] [--type=feature|bugfix|migration|refactor]` - Creates product spec and engineering design docs in `roadmap/`

**Default Composition**: `/requirements-start /execute /arch /principalproductmanager /principalengineer /tdd /thinku /research [current_date_search]`

🚨 **MANDATORY CURRENT DATE RESEARCH**: Must include fresh internet searches using current date (**$(date +"%B %d, %Y")**) to validate against latest industry trends, frameworks, and best practices. Avoid using outdated research when evaluating modern solutions.
**Parameters**:
- `feature-name`: Name of the feature/component to design
- `--type`: Optional type for customized templates (default: feature)
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` in templates for team customization

## ⚠️ **Selective Documentation Principle**

**SKIP sections that don't apply** - Don't force irrelevant content:
- **Bug fixes**: Skip user stories, focus on technical analysis
- **Infrastructure**: Skip UI/UX, focus on system design
- **Small features**: Skip risk assessment if trivial
- **Internal tools**: Skip user journey maps

**Quality over completeness** - Empty sections with good reason > Forced placeholder content

### **Section Relevance by Type**
- **Features**: Full product spec + engineering design
- **Bug fixes**: Focus on technical analysis, testing strategy, minimal product spec
- **Migrations**: Emphasize risk assessment, rollout plan, minimal UI requirements
- **Refactoring**: Focus on technical goals, success metrics, skip user stories
- **Infrastructure**: System design, monitoring, automation hooks - skip user journeys

## 🎯 Command Objectives

1. **Requirements First**: Start with `/requirements-start` to gather structured requirements through guided questions
2. **Prevent Issues Like React V2**: Enforce proper planning before implementation
3. **Feature Completeness**: Ensure all requirements are captured upfront
4. **Technical Clarity**: Define implementation approach before coding
5. **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of "done" before starting
6. **Methodology Enforcement**: Mandate /4layer, /tdd, /redgreen for quality
7. **Multi-Perspective Validation**: Combine architecture analysis with principal-level product and engineering expertise  
8. **Current Industry Standards**: Validate approach against 2025 best practices and emerging technologies
9. **TDD Implementation Planning**: Generate detailed sub-milestone breakdown with test-driven development integration
10. **Granular Progress Tracking**: Break features into ~100 line commits for better tracking and rollback safety

## 📋 Requirements Gathering Integration

The `/design` command now starts with `/requirements-start` to ensure comprehensive requirements are captured before creating design documents:

1. **Discovery Phase**: 5 yes/no questions to understand the problem space
2. **Context Analysis**: Autonomous codebase analysis to identify technical constraints
3. **Expert Questions**: 5 detailed yes/no questions based on findings
4. **Requirements Spec**: Generated requirements feed into design documents

This ensures design documents are grounded in validated requirements gathered through systematic questioning.

## 🔄 Session Continuity

**Link to Previous Work**: Reference related design decisions, previous sprints, and architectural choices to maintain development continuity across sessions.

**Team Integration**: All documents are git-friendly and can be shared across team members for collaborative development.

## 📋 Generated Documents

The `/design` command now generates **3 comprehensive documents** with TDD integration:

## 🚨 Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: Multi-Perspective Analysis (Enhanced)
1. **Architecture Assessment** (`/arch`): Technical approach and system design
2. **Product Strategy Review** (`/principalproductmanager`): User experience and business value
3. **Engineering Leadership** (`/principalengineer`): Technical excellence and scalability
4. **Critical Thinking** (`/thinku`): Challenge assumptions and identify risks
5. **Current Research** (`/research [current_date_search]`): 2025 industry standards and best practices

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
1. **Identify Feature Scope**: What are we building?
2. **User Research**: Who uses this and why?
3. **Existing Analysis**: What exists today (if migration)?

5. **Industry Validation**: How do current (2025) best practices inform our approach?

### Phase 2: Document Generation
1. **Create Product Spec**: User-focused requirements
2. **Create Eng Design**: Technical implementation details
3. **Cross-Validate**: Ensure eng design satisfies product spec
4. **Review Readiness**: All questions answered before coding

### Phase 3: Validation
- ✅ All user stories have acceptance criteria
- ✅ All components have data sources defined
- ✅ All APIs have schemas documented
- ✅ Testing strategy covers all user journeys
- ✅ No placeholders or "TBD" sections
- ✅ Multi-perspective analysis completed (product, engineering, architecture)
- ✅ Current industry standards (2025) validation performed
- ✅ Critical thinking challenges addressed

## 🎓 Lessons from React V2

**What This Prevents**:
1. **Hardcoded Values**: Data requirements defined upfront
2. **Missing Features**: Complete feature inventory before coding
3. **Broken Navigation**: User journeys mapped explicitly
4. **Placeholder Text**: All UI states documented
5. **Non-functional Buttons**: Interaction inventory required

**Key Principle**: "If it's not in the design docs, it's not in the feature"

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Frontend Migration
```
/design react-v3-migration
```
Generates:
- `roadmap/react-v3-migration_product_spec.md`

## 📚 Research-Based Best Practices

### LLM Documentation Principles (2025 Research)
Based on current prompt engineering research and AI software development trends:

1. **Structured Output Formatting**: Use consistent templates with clear delimiters (headers, bullets, code blocks)
2. **Context Hierarchy**: Priority-based information organization for better LLM comprehension
3. **Chain of Thought**: Explicit reasoning patterns in technical decisions
4. **Few-Shot Examples**: Concrete examples for abstract implementation patterns
5. **Active Voice**: Clear, actionable language that reduces ambiguity
6. **Measurable Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions for all requirements

### AI Development Integration Patterns
- **Role-Based Prompting**: Define clear roles for product vs engineering perspectives
- **Constraint-Driven Design**: Lead with technical and business constraints
- **Iterative Refinement**: Documentation as living prompts that improve with usage
- **Cross-Reference Linking**: Connect decisions to outcomes for learning

**Remember**: "A day of design saves a week of debugging" + "LLM-optimized specs save hours of clarification"

## 🚀 AI Development Considerations

### Parameter Usage (2025 Best Practices)
```markdown
/design $ARGUMENTS --type=feature
/design $ARGUMENTS --type=bugfix
/design $ARGUMENTS --type=migration
/design $ARGUMENTS --type=refactor
```

### Token Optimization
- Reusable templates reduce context by 20%
- Standardized sections improve AI comprehension
- Parameterized commands enable team consistency
- Session continuity maintains context across interactions

### Task Decomposition
- Break features into **independent parallel units**
- Each agent should produce **one focused PR**
- No blocking dependencies within phases
- Clear deliverables per agent

### AI Estimation Methodology

#### Step 1: Calculate Lines of Code
- Count specific changes needed per issue
- Include boilerplate, imports, tests
- Add 20% padding for discovered complexity

#### Step 2: Apply Velocity Stats
- **Base rate**: 820 lines/hour (from GitHub data)
- **Burst rate**: 1,500 lines/hour (peak performance, *not sustainable; for reference only—do not use for timeline projections*)
- **Sustainable rate**: 600 lines/hour (conservative; recommended for planning)

> **Note:** Use the **sustainable rate** for all timeline projections. The burst rate is for short, unsustained peaks and should *not* be used for planning or estimates.

#### Step 3: Add PR Overhead
- **Small PR**: 5 minutes (under 50 lines)
- **Medium PR**: 8 minutes (50-200 lines)
- **Large PR**: 12 minutes (200+ lines)

#### Step 4: Calculate Parallelism Benefit
- 2 agents: 30% time reduction
- 3-4 agents: 40% time reduction
- 5+ agents: 45% time reduction (diminishing returns)

#### Step 5: Add Integration Buffer
- Simple features: +10% time
- Complex features: +20% time
- Cross-cutting changes: +30% time

### Example Calculation
```
Feature: Fix React V2 (12 issues, ~510 lines)
Base time: 510 ÷ 820 = 37 minutes
PR overhead: 5 PRs × 5 min = 25 minutes
Subtotal: 62 minutes
Parallelism: 62 × 0.6 = 37 minutes
Integration: 37 × 1.2 = 44 minutes
Final: Add safety buffer for unforeseen issues (+60-100%): 44 × 1.6–2.0 = 70–90 minutes
```

### Velocity Multipliers (Data-Driven)
- **Human baseline**: 3 weeks for major feature
- **AI with good specs**: 2-3 days (10-15x faster)
- **AI without specs**: 4-6 days (5x faster)
- **Key**: Realistic estimates prevent timeline failures

### Success Patterns
1. **Micro-PR workflow**: Small, reviewable changes
2. **Continuous integration**: Merge every 15 minutes
3. **Test parallelism**: Tests developed alongside features
4. **Clear boundaries**: Each agent owns specific files/components

## 🥊 Phase 4: Adversarial Analysis (Auto-Triggered)

**MANDATORY FINAL STEP**: After completing design documentation, automatically trigger comprehensive adversarial analysis to challenge the proposed approach and identify simpler alternatives.

### Auto-Composition Commands
```
/thinku /devilsadvocate /archreview [design-scope]
```

### External Validation MCPs
**REQUIRED**: Consult external perspectives to challenge assumptions:

**Gemini MCP Consultation**:
```
mcp__gemini-cli-mcp__gemini_chat_pro:
"Challenge this architectural approach for a solo MVP developer. The proposed solution is [APPROACH_SUMMARY]. 

Key concerns:
- Custom infrastructure vs proven tools  
- Implementation complexity vs problem scope
- Solo maintainability vs team solutions
- MVP speed vs perfect engineering

What simpler alternatives exist? What are the long-term implications of building custom vs using standard solutions?"
```

**Perplexity MCP Research**:
```  
mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask:
"I'm reviewing an architectural decision for a solo MVP developer project: [PROBLEM_STATEMENT]

Proposed solution: [TECHNICAL_APPROACH]

From a software architecture perspective for MVP development, what approach makes the most sense? What are the long-term implications of building custom infrastructure vs using proven tooling? Focus on 2025 industry standards and best practices."
```

### Adversarial Challenge Framework

#### 🚨 **MVP Reality Check Questions**:
1. **Complexity Challenge**: "Is this solving the right problem or over-engineering a simple fix?"
2. **Standard Tools Challenge**: "What existing tools/frameworks solve this exact problem?"
3. **Solo Developer Challenge**: "Can one person realistically build and maintain this?"
4. **Speed Challenge**: "Does this help ship features faster or slower?"
5. **Technical Debt Challenge**: "Will this create more problems than it solves?"

#### 🎯 **Alternative Solutions Analysis**:
For each major design decision, identify and compare:
- **Simple Fix**: Minimal change that addresses core problem
- **Standard Solution**: Industry-proven tools/frameworks
- **Custom Solution**: Proposed approach (justify why needed)

#### 📊 **Impact Assessment Matrix**:
| Solution | Time to Implement | Maintenance Burden | Risk Level | MVP Suitability |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Simple Fix | [X minutes] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [1-5 rating] |
| Standard Tool | [X hours] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [1-5 rating] |
| Custom Build | [X days] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [1-5 rating] |

### Expected Outcomes

**Challenge Results**: Document findings from adversarial analysis:
- **Confirmed Decisions**: Approaches that survive scrutiny with rationale
- **Alternative Recommendations**: Simpler/better solutions discovered  
- **Risk Mitigations**: How to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality
- **Implementation Priority**: What to build first vs defer vs eliminate

**Success Criteria**: Design is approved for implementation only if:
- [ ] External perspectives (Gemini + Perplexity) consulted
- [ ] Simpler alternatives identified and compared
- [ ] Custom infrastructure decisions justified vs standard tools
- [ ] Solo developer maintainability confirmed
- [ ] MVP speed priorities addressed

### Integration with Memory MCP

**Capture Architectural Learnings**:
```
mcp__memory-server__create_entities:
- Architecture decisions and rationales
- Design patterns that work/fail for solo MVP
- Standard tool evaluations and outcomes  
- Performance vs complexity trade-offs
- Solo developer workflow optimizations
```

**Purpose**: Prevent repeated architectural mistakes and build institutional knowledge for future design decisions.
