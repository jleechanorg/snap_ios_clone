## Review Tone Guidelines

### ‚ùå Avoid (Too Positive)
```
"‚úÖ Excellent work!"
"Great implementation!"
"This looks good!"
Rating: 9/10
```

### ‚úÖ Use (Critical Focus)
```
‚ùå **Major Issue**: Specific problem with impact
‚ö†Ô∏è **Design Flaw**: Pattern violation with consequences
üîß **Refactor Needed**: Complex logic requires simplification
üìà **Performance Risk**: Inefficient algorithm in critical path
üö® **Security Gap**: Missing validation creates vulnerability
```

## Review Process

### 1. Problem Detection
- **File Size Analysis**: Flag files >500 lines
- **Complexity Metrics**: Detect deep nesting (>4 levels)
- **Method Length**: Flag methods >50 lines
- **Duplication Detection**: Identify copy-paste code
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detect anti-patterns and code smells

### 2. Impact Assessment
- **Performance Impact**: High/Medium/Low
- **Security Risk**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Maintenance Burden**: High/Medium/Low
- **Business Risk**: Critical/High/Medium/Low

### 3. Actionable Feedback
```
## Required Changes
1. Extract UserValidator class from AuthController (SRP violation)
2. Add input sanitization before database queries (security)
3. Replace nested loops with hash-based lookup (performance)
4. Add unit tests for edge cases (quality)
```

## Detection Patterns

### Architecture Red Flags
```python
# ‚ùå Tight Coupling
class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = MySQLDatabase()  # Hard dependency

# ‚ùå God Object
class UserManager:  # 500+ lines doing everything
    def create_user(self): pass
    def authenticate(self): pass
    def send_email(self): pass
    def generate_report(self): pass
```

### Performance Red Flags
```python
# ‚ùå O(n¬≤) Algorithm
for user in users:
    for other in users:  # Nested iteration
        if user.matches(other):

# ‚ùå Database in Loop
for item in items:
    db.query(f"SELECT * FROM related WHERE id={item.id}")
```

### Security Red Flags
```python
# ‚ùå SQL Injection
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='{user_input}'"

# ‚ùå Missing Validation
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update(user_id, data)  # No input validation
```

## Integration

### GitHub API Usage
- `gh pr list --limit N` - Get recent PRs
- `gh pr view PR# --json files,body` - Get PR details
- `gh pr comment PR# --body "review"` - Post review

### File Analysis
- Parse changed files for patterns
- Calculate complexity metrics
- Detect architectural violations
- Identify security risks

### Comment Posting
- Post as "from super reviewer"
- Include file:line references
- Provide specific code examples
- Give actionable recommendations

## Quality Standards

### Every Review Must Include:
1. **Specific Problems**: Not generic concerns
2. **Code Examples**: Actual problematic code snippets
3. **Impact Analysis**: Why each issue matters
4. **Actionable Fixes**: Concrete steps to improve
5. **Honest Rating**: Realistic score reflecting issues

### Review Quality Metrics:
- **Problem Detection Rate**: Issues per 100 lines
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% of flagged issues
- **Actionability Score**: >80% of suggestions implementable
- **Developer Response**: Comments address real concerns

## Command Chaining

```bash
/reviewsuper /timeout strict     # Fast critical review
/reviewsuper --security /arch    # Combined security + architecture
/arch /reviewsuper              # Deep analysis then critical review
```

## Example Output

```
## üîç Critical Architecture Review
**from super reviewer**

### Major Concerns
‚ùå **Tight Coupling**: AuthService directly instantiates EmailProvider (auth.py:45)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Validation**: User input passed directly to database (user.py:123)
üîß **Complex Logic**: 8-level nested conditionals in payment processing (payment.py:67-89)

### Architecture Analysis
The authentication system violates dependency inversion by hard-coding email dependencies. This makes testing difficult and prevents swapping email providers. The payment logic has grown into an unmaintainable nested structure that's error-prone and hard to debug.

### Required Actions
1. Extract EmailProvider interface and inject dependency
2. Add input sanitization layer before database operations
3. Refactor payment logic using strategy pattern
4. Add unit tests for edge cases (currently 0% coverage)

### Risk Assessment
- **Performance Impact**: Medium (email blocking auth flow)
- **Security Risk**: High (SQL injection possible)
- **Maintenance Burden**: High (complex nested logic)

**Critical Rating**: 4/10 - Multiple design flaws require immediate attention
