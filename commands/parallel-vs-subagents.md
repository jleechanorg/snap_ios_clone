# Parallel Tasks vs Subagents Reference Guide

**Purpose**: Central reference for deciding between parallel tasks and subagents to optimize token usage

## Quick Decision Guide

### ðŸš€ Use Parallel Tasks (0 extra tokens)

**When**: Simple, independent operations < 30 seconds each
**How**: Background processes, GNU parallel, xargs, or batched tool calls

### ðŸ¤– Use Subagents (~50k+ tokens each)

**When**: Complex workflows, different directories, or operations > 5 minutes
**Cost**: 100x more expensive than parallel tasks

## Implementation Methods

### 1. Background Processes (Bash &)
```bash
# Best for: 2-10 simple commands
(command1) &
(command2) &
(command3) &
wait
```
**Pros**: Simple, built-in, error handling possible
**Cons**: Manual PID management, limited scaling

### 2. GNU Parallel
```bash
# Best for: Structured parallel execution
parallel -j 4 ::: "cmd1" "cmd2" "cmd3" "cmd4"

# With input files
parallel -a files.txt process_file {}
```
**Pros**: Advanced job control, progress bars, automatic load balancing
**Cons**: Requires installation, learning curve

### 3. xargs Parallel
```bash
# Best for: Processing file lists
find . -name "*.py" | xargs -P 8 -I {} python lint.py {}
```
**Pros**: Standard Unix tool, efficient for file operations
**Cons**: Limited error handling, basic job control

### 4. Batched Tool Calls
```python
# Best for: Multiple Claude tool calls
# Execute multiple searches/reads in one response
```
**Pros**: Most efficient for Claude operations, atomic execution
**Cons**: Limited to tool capabilities

## Decision Criteria

| Factor | Parallel Tasks | Subagents |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Token Cost | ~0 additional | ~50k+ each |
| Execution Time | < 30 seconds | > 5 minutes |
| Complexity | Simple, independent | Complex, multi-step |
| Directory | Same working dir | Different branches/dirs |
| Failure Handling | Basic | Advanced isolation |
| Context Needed | Shared | Independent |

## Common Scenarios

### âœ… Perfect for Parallel Tasks
- Search codebase for patterns
- Run test suites
- Check multiple PR statuses
- Lint multiple files
- Aggregate data from APIs
- Build multiple components

### âœ… Requires Subagents
- Implement new features
- Fix complex bugs
- Create/update PRs
- Multi-branch operations
- Architectural changes
- Long-running migrations

## Token Cost Examples

```
10 file searches:
- Parallel: 0 additional tokens
- Subagents: 500,000+ tokens (10 Ã— 50k)
- Savings: 100%

Feature implementation:
- Parallel: Not suitable (complex workflow)
- Subagent: 50k tokens (justified by complexity)
```

## Monitoring Success

```bash
# Before optimization
ccusage daily --instances

# After switching to parallel
ccusage daily --instances --since 2025-07-29

# Expected: 90%+ reduction in token usage
```

**Remember**: Default to parallel tasks. Only use subagents when truly needed for complexity or isolation.
