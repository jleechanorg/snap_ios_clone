# Plan Command - Execute with Approval

**Purpose**: Same as `/execute` but requires user approval before implementation. **OPTIMIZED FOR MAXIMUM /CEREBRAS CODE GENERATION BATCHING** to leverage 19.6x speed advantage.

**Usage**: `/plan` - Present execution plan with maximum coding work batched for /cerebras

## 🚀 MAXIMUM /CEREBRAS BATCHING STRATEGY (PRIMARY FOCUS)

**REVOLUTIONARY SPEED**: /cerebras can generate code up to 19.6x faster (e.g., 500ms vs 10s in example scenarios) – this is the PRIMARY optimization target. *Note: These metrics are based on internal observations and may vary depending on workload and environment.*

### Batch-First Workflow Philosophy
**The planning process MUST prioritize identifying and batching ALL possible coding work for /cerebras upfront**:

1. **📋 CODING TASK INVENTORY** (First Step - MANDATORY):
   - **Scan the entire task** for ANY code generation opportunities
   - **Group similar coding tasks** that can be generated together
   - **Identify boilerplate patterns** that /cerebras excels at
   - **List ALL files/functions/classes** that need creation or major modification

2. **🎯 MAXIMUM BATCH IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **New file creation** - Perfect for /cerebras with detailed specs
   - **Function implementations** - Batch multiple functions with clear interfaces
   - **Test generation** - Batch ALL tests for multiple modules
   - **Data structures** - Create multiple related classes/interfaces
   - **Configuration files** - Generate multiple config variations
   - **Documentation** - Batch documentation for multiple components

3. **⚡ BATCH EXECUTION STRATEGY**:
   - **Front-load ALL /cerebras implementation tasks** ahead of any Claude implementation
   - Perform only minimal Claude analysis/spec creation required to enable /cerebras batching
   - **Generate code in logical groups** (all models, all tests, all configs)
   - **Minimize context switching** between generation and analysis
   - **Parallel generation** when possible for independent components

## 🚨 CRITICAL: SERENA MCP USAGE FOR PR WORK

**MANDATORY for Large PRs (50+ files)**: When working on PR analysis or fixes, ALWAYS use Serena MCP tools as primary approach:

### Serena MCP First Protocol
1. **❌ NEVER start by reading entire files** - This wastes context immediately
2. **✅ ALWAYS use Serena semantic tools first**:
   - `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Target specific functions/classes
   - `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` - Understand file structure
   - `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` - Find code patterns efficiently
   - `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` - Track dependencies

### Example PR Fix Workflow
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Reading entire files
Read --file_path="mvp_site/frontend_v2/src/App.tsx"  # Wastes 1000+ lines of context!

# ✅ RIGHT: Targeted Serena analysis
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern --pattern="\\(campaign as any\\)" --restrict_search_to_code_files=true
mcp__serena__find_symbol --name_path="handleCampaignCreate" --include_body=true
```

### Context Preservation Rules
- **First 20% of context**: Use Serena for analysis and discovery
- **Middle 60% of context**: Apply targeted fixes using Edit/MultiEdit
- **Final 20% of context**: Verification and testing
- **If context < 30%**: Split task or summarize findings

## 🧠 MEMORY INTEGRATION

**Enhanced Planning with Memory MCP**: `/plan` automatically consults Memory MCP before creating execution plans to apply learned patterns, user preferences, and corrections.

### Pre-Planning Memory Query
- **Automatic Consultation**: Queries learned patterns relevant to the task
- **Pattern Categorization**: Groups findings by type (corrections, preferences, workflows)
- **Context Integration**: Applies memory insights to planning decisions
- **Execution Strategy**: Uses memory patterns to inform parallel vs sequential choices

## 📋 GUIDELINES INTEGRATION

**Mistake Prevention System**: `/plan` automatically checks for and applies guidelines from `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md` to prevent recurring mistakes.

### Pre-Planning Guidelines Check

**Systematic Mistake Prevention**: This command automatically consults the mistake prevention guidelines system by calling `/guidelines` directly.

**Direct Command Composition**:
1. **Execute `/guidelines`**: Call the guidelines command for comprehensive consultation
2. **Guidelines automatically handles**:
   - Read CLAUDE.md for current rules, constraints, and protocols (MANDATORY)
   - Read base guidelines from `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md`
   - Detect PR/branch context using GitHub API, branch name patterns, and fallbacks
   - Create/read specific guidelines:
     * PR-specific: `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md`
     * Branch-specific: `docs/branch-guidelines/{BRANCH_NAME}/guidelines.md`  
     * Base-only: `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md`
   - Apply guidelines context to inform planning approach
3. **Proceed with planning workflow** using guidelines context from `/guidelines` output

**Guidelines Integration**: Direct command composition - `/plan` calls `/guidelines` directly for clean separation of concerns and reliable guidelines consultation.

## 🚨 PLAN PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: /CEREBRAS BATCH INVENTORY (PRIMARY STEP - MANDATORY)

**🚀 MAXIMUM CODE GENERATION BATCHING CHECKLIST**:
```
## /CEREBRAS BATCHING PROTOCOL - SPEED-OPTIMIZED PLANNING
- [ ] 📋 COMPLETE CODING TASK INVENTORY: ✅ MANDATORY FIRST STEP
  *Required*: List EVERY possible code generation opportunity in the task
  *Examples*: New files, functions, classes, tests, configs, documentation
  *Guideline*: Aim to batch at least 80% of coding work to /cerebras, as maximizing batching leverages the 19.6x speed advantage. This percentage is a recommended target based on observed efficiency gains, but use your judgment for complex or edge cases.
- [ ] 🎯 BATCH GROUPING STRATEGY:
  - [ ] File creation batches: Group related new files
  - [ ] Function implementation batches: Group similar functions
  - [ ] Test generation batches: Group tests by module/feature
  - [ ] Configuration batches: Group related config files
  - [ ] Documentation batches: Group docs by component
- [ ] ⚡ SPEED OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS:
  - [ ] Estimated /cerebras tasks: _____ (aim for maximum possible)
  - [ ] Estimated Claude tasks: _____ (minimize to analysis/integration only)
  - [ ] Speed benefit calculation: _____
    *Guidance*: Estimate speed benefit by considering:
      - Baseline /cerebras speedup (e.g., 19.6x for simple tasks)
      - Average task complexity (simple/complex/mixed)
      - Context switching overhead (e.g., time lost switching between tools or batches)
      - Integration time (e.g., time to merge, test, and validate batched outputs)
    *Suggested formula*: 
      Estimated speed benefit = (Baseline speedup × /cerebras task count × Complexity factor) - (Context switching overhead + Integration time)
    *Note*: Adjust 'Complexity factor' (e.g., 1 for simple, <1 for complex tasks). Document assumptions.
  - [ ] Batching efficiency: High/Medium/Low (aim for High)
- [ ] Guidelines consultation completed: ✅ `/guidelines` command executed successfully
- [ ] Anti-patterns avoided: Reference historical mistakes and solutions
- [ ] Memory consultation completed: ✅ YES
- [ ] Memory insights applied: [Count] relevant patterns found
- [ ] Context check: ___% remaining
- [ ] Complexity assessment: Simple/Complex (memory and guidelines informed)
- [ ] Tool selection validated: Serena MCP → Read tool → Bash → /cerebras (per guidelines)
- [ ] /cerebras delegation analysis: ✅ MANDATORY - Identified which parts suit /cerebras vs Claude
  *Required*: Must explicitly list tasks for /cerebras (well-specified generation) vs Claude (understanding/integration)
  *Reference*: Read CLAUDE.md "/CEREBRAS HYBRID CODE GENERATION PROTOCOL" section for refresher on /cerebras usage patterns
  *Decision Log*: Document all /cerebras delegation decisions in cerebras_decisions.md
- [ ] Execution method decision: /cerebras-First → Parallel → Sequential
  *Priority*: /cerebras batching takes precedence over parallelization decisions
  *Reference*: See [parallel-vs-subagents.md](./parallel-vs-subagents.md) for decision criteria
- [ ] **🚀 /CEREBRAS BATCH EXECUTION PLAN** presented to user
- [ ] User approval received
```
