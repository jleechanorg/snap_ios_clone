# /ghfixtests

Find recent PRs with failing tests and offer to fix them via Claude Code Action comments.

## Description

This command:
1. Scans the last 10-20 open PRs for failing unit tests
2. Shows a summary of which PRs have test failures
3. Asks if you want to post `@claude-code-action` comments to fix them
4. Posts the comments with context about what's failing

## Usage

```
/ghfixtests
```

## Behavior

1. **Scan PRs**: Check CI status of recent open PRs
2. **Filter failures**: Only show PRs where unit tests are failing
3. **Display summary**: Show PR number, title, and what's failing
4. **Interactive prompt**: Ask which PRs to fix (all, specific numbers, or none)
5. **Post comments**: Create targeted `@claude-code-action fix unit tests` comments with failure context

## Example Output
