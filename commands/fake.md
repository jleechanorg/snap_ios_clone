# Fake Code Detection Command

**Purpose**: Detect fake, demo, or simulated code that isn't truly working using research-backed pattern recognition with Memory MCP integration and real-time hook validation

**Usage**: `/fake` - Comprehensive audit for non-functional code patterns with 900% improved detection capability

## 🚨 ENHANCED DETECTION SYSTEM

**Research Foundation**: Based on comprehensive multi-phase research (August 2025) incorporating:
- Google's 17% improvement methodology via self-reflection
- Meta's 71% hallucination reduction techniques  
- Stanford NLP semantic entropy methods
- MIT multi-agent verification systems

**Real-time Integration**: Automatically uses the advanced detection hook system at `/home/jleechan/projects/worldarchitect.ai/.claude/hooks/detect_speculation_and_fake_code.sh` which has proven 900% detection improvement over legacy approaches.

## 🔄 RELATED COMMANDS

**Light Alternative**: For quick screening, use `/fakel` command which provides the same detection patterns with faster analysis (4 thoughts vs 10+ thoughts).

## 🚨 COMMAND COMPOSITION

This command combines: `/arch /thinku /devilsadvocate /diligent`

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This composition MUST be executed with Memory MCP integration as described in the Execution Protocol below. The Memory MCP operations are MANDATORY, not optional.

**Composition Logic**:
- **Architecture Analysis** (/arch): Understand system design and integration points
- **Deep Thinking** (/thinku): Thorough analysis of code functionality (10+ thoughts)
- **Devil's Advocate** (/devilsadvocate): Challenge assumptions about what works
- **Diligent Review** (/diligent): Methodical examination of implementation details

## 🔍 DETECTION TARGETS

### Research-Validated Pattern Categories (21 Total Patterns)

#### Speculation Patterns (9 patterns)
- **Temporal Speculation**: "I'll wait for", "let me wait", "waiting for completion"
- **State Assumptions**: "command is running", "system processing", "while executing"  
- **Outcome Predictions**: "should see", "will result", "expect to"
- **Process Speculation**: "during process", "as it runs", "once complete"

#### Fake Code Patterns (12 patterns)
- **Placeholder Code**: "TODO: implement", "FIXME", "dummy value", "placeholder for real validation"
- **Non-functional Logic**: "return null # stub", "throw NotImplemented", debug code left in production
- **Template/Demo Code**: "Example implementation", "Sample code", "This example", "Basic template"
- **Duplicate Logic**: "copy from", "similar to", "based on existing"
- **Parallel Systems**: "create new instead", "replace existing with", "simpler version of"

#### Legacy CLAUDE.md Violations
- **Demo Files**: Non-functional demonstration code
- **Fake Intelligence**: Python files simulating .md logic
- **Template Responses**: Generic replies without real analysis
- **Mock Implementations**: Functions that simulate rather than implement

### Code Quality Indicators
- **TODO/FIXME**: Unfinished implementation markers
- **Hardcoded Values**: Non-configurable demo data
- **Missing Error Handling**: Code that works only in perfect conditions
- **Incomplete Integration**: Functions that don't connect to real systems
- **Test-Only Logic**: Code that only works in test environments

## 🎯 ANALYSIS SCOPE

### Branch Comparison
- **Local vs Main**: Compare current branch against main branch
- **Local vs Remote PR**: Compare against remote PR if exists
- **Integration Points**: Check how changes affect existing systems
- **Dependency Analysis**: Verify all dependencies are real and functional

### File Type Focus
- **Python Files**: Check for actual functionality vs simulation
- **Configuration**: Verify settings connect to real services
- **Scripts**: Ensure automation actually works
- **Tests**: Distinguish real tests from fake validations
- **Documentation**: Flag docs describing non-existent features

## 🚨 EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**⚠️ MANDATORY**: When executing /fake, you MUST perform the Memory MCP operations described below. These are NOT optional documentation - they are required execution steps.

### Phase 0: Memory Enhancement (Memory MCP Integration)
**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:

1. **Search for existing fake patterns**:
   ```python
   🔍 Searching memory for fake patterns...
   result1 = mcp__memory-server__search_nodes("fake_patterns OR placeholder_code OR demo_files OR fake_implementation")
   ```

2. **Get branch-specific patterns**:
   ```python
   import subprocess
   current_branch = subprocess.check_output(["git", "branch", "--show-current"], text=True).strip()
   result2 = mcp__memory-server__search_nodes(f"fake patterns {current_branch}")
   ```

3. **Log results**:
   - Show: "🔍 Memory searched: {len(result1.entities + result2.entities)} relevant fake patterns found"
   - If patterns found, list them briefly
   - Use these patterns to inform subsequent analysis

**Integration**: The memory context MUST inform all subsequent analysis phases

### Enhanced Composition Execution

Execute the composed commands WITH memory context awareness:

### Phase 1: Architecture Analysis (/arch)
**System Understanding** (enhanced with memory):
- Map current system architecture
- Pay special attention to areas where fake patterns were previously found
- Identify integration boundaries
- Understand data flow and dependencies
- Analyze how changes fit into existing system

### Phase 2: Deep Thinking (/thinku)
**Thorough Code Analysis** (10+ thoughts, informed by memory):
- Trace execution paths through new code
- Verify each function actually performs its stated purpose
- Check for patterns similar to remembered fake implementations
- Check error handling and edge cases
- Analyze resource usage and performance implications

### Phase 3: Devil's Advocate (/devilsadvocate)
**Challenge Assumptions** (using historical knowledge):
- Question whether code actually works as claimed
- Look for scenarios where code would fail
- Use past fake patterns to challenge current implementations
- Challenge integration assumptions
- Verify all dependencies are available and functional

### Phase 4: Diligent Review (/diligent)
**Methodical Examination** (with specific attention to problem areas):
- Line-by-line code review for fake patterns
- Focus on file types/areas that historically had fake implementations
- Verify all imports resolve to real modules
- Check configuration values point to real resources
- Validate test assertions match actual behavior

### Phase 5: Self-Reflection Integration (Research-Backed Improvement)
**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:

1. **Trigger Hook-Based Self-Reflection**:
   - Process detected fake code through enhanced reflection pipeline
   - Apply Google's 17% improvement methodology via self-questioning
   - Generate specific corrective guidance for each violation
   
2. **Document Self-Correction Success**:
   - Track before/after comparison of code quality
   - Log successful transformations from fake to functional code
   - Measure improvement in real-world implementations

### Phase 6: Memory Persistence (Store Learnings)
**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:

After analysis completes, store new findings:

1. **For each fake pattern found**:
   ```python
   pattern_name = f"{pattern_type}_{timestamp}"
   mcp__memory-server__create_entities([{
     "name": pattern_name,
     "entityType": "fake_code_pattern",
     "observations": [
       "Description of pattern",
       f"Location: {file}:{line}",
       f"Detection method: {method}",
       f"Found on branch: {current_branch}",
       f"Detected by: /fake command",
       f"Self-reflection triggered: {reflection_applied}",
       f"Correction guidance: {guidance_provided}"
     ]
   }])
   ```

2. **Create relationships** (if applicable):
   ```python
   mcp__memory-server__create_relations([{
     "from": pattern_name,
     "to": component_name,
     "relationType": "found_in"
   }])
   ```

3. **Log storage**:
   - Show: "📚 Stored {count} new fake patterns in memory for future detection"
   - List what was stored for transparency

**Benefits**: Builds persistent knowledge base for improved future detection
