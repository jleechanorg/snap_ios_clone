# Execute Command Protocol Learning

## Issue Observed
The `/e` command appears to "do nothing" when used improperly.

## Root Cause
The `/e` command has MANDATORY protocol steps that must be followed:

1. **Context Assessment** - Check available context percentage
2. **Subagent Analysis** - Determine if subagents are needed
3. **User Confirmation** - Present plan and get explicit approval
4. **ONLY THEN** - Begin milestone-based execution

## What Happens When Protocol Is Skipped
If you start executing immediately without the approval steps, it appears the command "does nothing" because:
- The assistant jumps straight to work
- No formal milestone tracking is initiated
- The structured execution framework is bypassed

## Correct Usage
```
