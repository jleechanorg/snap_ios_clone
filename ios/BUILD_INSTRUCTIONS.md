# iOS Build Instructions

## Current Status
- ✅ Source code is ready (20,000+ lines of Swift)
- ⏳ Xcode installation in progress
- ⏳ iOS Simulator setup pending

## Prerequisites
1. **Xcode 15.0+** (currently installing)
2. **iOS 16.0+ Simulator**
3. **Firebase Account** for backend services

## Build Steps (Once Xcode is Ready)

### 1. Install Xcode
```bash
# Option 1: Mac App Store (current method)
mas install 497799835

# Option 2: Apple Developer Portal
# Download from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

### 2. Create iOS Project
```bash
cd ios
# We need to create a proper .xcodeproj from our Swift Package
```

### 3. Project Structure Conversion
The current structure is a Swift Package but needs to be an iOS App:

**Current Structure:**
```
ios/SnapClone/
├── Package.swift          # Swift Package manifest
├── SnapClone/            # Source files
│   ├── App.swift         # Main app entry point
│   ├── Models/          # Data models
│   ├── Views/           # SwiftUI views
│   ├── ViewModels/      # MVVM logic
│   └── Services/        # Firebase services
└── SnapCloneTests/      # Test suite
```

**Required iOS App Structure:**
```
SnapCloneApp.xcodeproj/
├── SnapCloneApp/
│   ├── App.swift        # @main entry point
│   ├── Info.plist       # App configuration
│   ├── Models/          # Move from current location
│   ├── Views/           # Move from current location
│   ├── ViewModels/      # Move from current location
│   └── Services/        # Move from current location
├── SnapCloneAppTests/   # Move tests
└── project.pbxproj      # Xcode project file
```

### 4. Dependencies
The app uses Swift Package Manager dependencies:
- Firebase SDK (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging)
- Kingfisher (Image caching)
- SwiftUI Navigation (Enhanced navigation)
- Combine Schedulers (Testing utilities)

### 5. Firebase Configuration
```bash
# 1. Download GoogleService-Info.plist from Firebase Console
# 2. Place in SnapCloneApp/ directory
# 3. Add to Xcode project target
```

### 6. Build Commands
```bash
# Build for simulator
xcodebuild -project SnapCloneApp.xcodeproj -scheme SnapCloneApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build

# Run in simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15"
xcrun simctl install booted ./build/SnapCloneApp.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.snapclone.app
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ **Xcode Installation**: Complete installation (in progress)
2. 🔄 **Create iOS Project**: Convert Swift Package to iOS App
3. 🔄 **Firebase Setup**: Configure backend services
4. 🔄 **Build & Test**: Compile and run in simulator

## Expected Timeline
- Xcode Installation: 15-30 minutes (depends on internet speed)
- Project Setup: 5 minutes
- Firebase Configuration: 10 minutes
- First Build: 5-10 minutes (dependency download)

## Troubleshooting
- If Xcode installation fails, download manually from Apple Developer
- Ensure iOS 16+ Simulator is available
- Check Firebase project configuration
- Verify Apple Developer account for device testing

## Performance Expectations
- **App Size**: ~50MB (with Firebase dependencies)
- **Build Time**: 2-3 minutes (first build), 30s (incremental)
- **Startup Time**: <2 seconds in simulator
- **Memory Usage**: ~100MB typical usage

## Features Ready to Test
- ✅ Camera capture (simulator will use placeholder)
- ✅ User authentication flow
- ✅ Real-time messaging
- ✅ Story system
- ✅ Friends management
- ✅ Profile settings
