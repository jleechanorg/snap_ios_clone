# Enhanced Memory MCP Integration Patterns

This document defines how commands should integrate with Memory MCP to create high-quality, actionable memory entries.

## Core Integration Principle

**Before any enhanced command execution**:
1. ‚úÖ Search Memory MCP for relevant context
2. ‚úÖ Extract specific technical terms from command arguments
3. ‚úÖ Log search results transparently
4. ‚úÖ Integrate found memories naturally into response
5. ‚úÖ Capture new learnings with structured, detailed entries

## Enhanced Commands Memory Integration

### /learn Command Enhancement

**Current State**: Generic observations like "Values evidence-based development"
**Enhanced Pattern**:

```markdown
## /learn Enhanced Implementation

**Pre-execution**:
- Extract technical terms: error messages, file names, PR numbers, technologies
- Search memory: `mcp__memory-server__search_nodes(technical_terms)`
- Log: "üîç Memory searched: X relevant memories found"

**Memory Capture Pattern**:
```json
{
  "name": "{specific_learning_identifier}",
  "entityType": "technical_learning",
  "observations": [
    "Context: {specific situation with timestamp}",
    "Technical Detail: {exact error/solution/code}",
    "Location: {file:line or command or environment}",
    "Solution Applied: {specific steps taken}",
    "Outcome: {measurable result}",
    "Reusable Pattern: {how to apply elsewhere}",
    "References: {PR links, commits, files}"
  ]
}
```

**Example Enhanced /learn**:
```bash
User: /learn the Firebase timeout issue was fixed by increasing timeout
Enhanced Capture:
{
  "name": "firebase_auth_timeout_fix_2025_07_23",
  "entityType": "technical_solution",
  "observations": [
    "Issue: Firebase Auth timeout in user authentication flow",
    "Error: 'firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword() timed out'",
    "Location: mvp_site/firebase_util.py:45",
    "Root Cause: Default 30s timeout insufficient for Auth API",
    "Solution: Increased timeout to 60s via firebase.auth().timeout = 60000",
    "Code Change: Line 12 firebase_util.py timeout parameter",
    "Test Result: 15/15 auth tests now pass",
    "Performance: Average auth time 2.3s, max observed 45s",
    "Commit: a1b2c3d 'Increase Firebase Auth timeout for reliability'"
  ]
}
```

### /debug Command Enhancement

**Memory Pattern**: Capture complete debugging journey

```json
{
  "name": "{system}_{issue}_{resolution_date}",
  "entityType": "debug_session",
  "observations": [
    "Initial Symptom: {exact error message or behavior}",
    "Investigation Steps: {specific debugging actions taken}",
    "Key Discovery: {root cause finding with evidence}",
    "Failed Attempts: {what didn't work and why}",
    "Working Solution: {exact fix with code/config}",
    "Verification: {how solution was confirmed}",
    "Prevention: {how to avoid this issue future}"
  ]
}
```

### /fix Command Enhancement

**Memory Pattern**: Document fix implementation and validation

```json
{
  "name": "{component}_{fix_type}_{implementation_date}",
  "entityType": "fix_implementation",
  "observations": [
    "Problem Statement: {specific issue description}",
    "Impact Analysis: {who/what was affected}",
    "Fix Strategy: {approach chosen and why}",
    "Implementation: {exact code changes made}",
    "Testing Protocol: {how fix was validated}",
    "Rollback Plan: {how to undo if needed}",
    "Related Issues: {other similar problems this addresses}"
  ]
}
```

### /pr Command Enhancement

**Memory Pattern**: Preserve PR insights and workflow learnings

```json
{
  "name": "pr_{pr_number}_{insight_type}_{date}",
  "entityType": "pr_workflow_insight",
  "observations": [
    "PR: #{pr_number} {github_url}",
    "Changes Summary: {what was implemented}",
    "Review Insights: {valuable feedback received}",
    "Automated Feedback: {Copilot/bot suggestions}",
    "Resolution Strategy: {how issues were addressed}",
    "Workflow Lesson: {process improvement identified}",
    "Code Quality Impact: {metrics or observations}"
  ]
}
```

### /execute Command Enhancement

**Memory Pattern**: Track implementation patterns and outcomes

```json
{
  "name": "{feature}_{implementation_approach}_{outcome}",
  "entityType": "implementation_pattern",
  "observations": [
    "Task: {specific implementation goal}",
    "Approach: {technical strategy chosen}",
    "Key Decisions: {important choices made and rationale}",
    "Implementation Details: {specific code patterns used}",
    "Challenges Encountered: {obstacles and solutions}",
    "Performance Metrics: {measurable outcomes}",
    "Reusability: {how pattern applies to other contexts}"
  ]
}
```

## Memory Search Enhancement

**Enhanced Search Pattern**:
```markdown
üîç **Searching memory for: "{extracted_terms}"**

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary terms: {technical_keywords}
- Related concepts: {semantic_expansions}
- Historical context: {timeline_relevance}

**Results Integration**:
- Found {X} relevant memories
- Key insights: {summarized_learnings}
- Applied context: {how_memories_informed_response}
```

## Relation Building

**Automatic Relation Creation**:
- Link new entries to existing technical entities
- Connect fixes to original problems
- Associate patterns with user preferences
- Build implementation genealogies

**Example Relations**:
```json
[
  {
    "from": "firebase_auth_timeout_fix_2025_07_23",
    "to": "firebase_auth_timeout_2025_07_23",
    "relationType": "fixes"
  },
  {
    "from": "firebase_auth_timeout_fix_2025_07_23",
    "to": "mvp_site_firebase_util",
    "relationType": "implemented_in"
  }
]
```

## Quality Validation

**Pre-storage Validation**:
- ‚úÖ Contains specific technical details
- ‚úÖ Includes actionable information
- ‚úÖ References external artifacts
- ‚úÖ Uses canonical entity names
- ‚úÖ Provides measurable outcomes
- ‚úÖ Links to related memories

**Enhancement Triggers**:
- If entry lacks specifics ‚Üí Prompt for technical details
- If no references ‚Üí Ask for PR/commit/file links
- If vague outcome ‚Üí Request measurable results
- If isolated ‚Üí Search for related entities to link

## Implementation Guidelines

**For Command Authors**:
1. **Always search first**: Use relevant terms to find existing context
2. **Extract specifics**: Pull out file names, error messages, PR numbers
3. **Structure observations**: Use the patterns defined above
4. **Build relations**: Connect to existing memories explicitly
5. **Validate quality**: Ensure entries meet high-quality criteria

**Memory Enhancement Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Search for context
search_terms = extract_technical_terms(command_args)
existing_memories = mcp__memory-server__search_nodes(search_terms)

# 2. Process with context
response = process_command_with_context(existing_memories)

# 3. Capture new learnings
new_learning = structure_memory_entry(response, patterns)
mcp__memory-server__create_entities([new_learning])

# 4. Build relations
relations = identify_relations(new_learning, existing_memories)
mcp__memory-server__create_relations(relations)
```
